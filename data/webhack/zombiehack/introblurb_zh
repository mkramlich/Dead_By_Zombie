The world is being overrun by zombies that want to kill you and eat your brain. Of course, this may result in turning you into a zombie too! Your challenge is to try to survive alive and non-zombie, find a place of reasonable safety, and then either wait for the zombie menace to subside, or, even better, actively assist in coming up with a cure. If you can help other people survive, even better. There may be worse things than dying. If you're not careful you could end up the last of the human race!
It's not safe out here.
It may be smart to first get back to your house as soon as you can. There you have some food and a first-aid kit, and a chainsaw to keep the evil away. You could hole up inside and plan your next moves.
Your house is in the north-west part of the neighborhood in which you start.
