Tonight we cross the final barrier in Man's exploration of Nature. Tonight the dead will rise.
Day is for the Living, Night is for the dead.
Musn't stop now. Just when my mad plans are finally coming to fruition.
Tonight my mad plan to rule the world comes to fruition!
Forecast tonight calls for partly living, partly dead, mostly shambling and a chance for tasty brains by midnight.
I'm quite normal, really.
I hear the clock tick-tocking. I love the sound of clock tick-tocks.
