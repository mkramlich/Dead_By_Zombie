The world is being overrun by zombies that want to kill you and eat your brain. Of course, this may result in turning you into a zombie too! Your challenge is to try to survive alive and non-zombie, find a place of reasonable safety, and then either wait for the zombie menace to subside, or, even better, actively assist in coming up with a cure. If you can help other people survive, even better. There may be worse things than dying. If you're not careful you could end up the last of the human race!
