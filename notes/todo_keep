inform user somewhere that:
    if he's wielding a bat or knife while attacking he'll do more damage
    if he's wearing leather jacket when being attacked he'll be safer or take less dmg


user command to toggle whether to show worn things in the Inventory display
    also one for wielded things, and for misc things (things not worn/wielded)
the usercmd button for these toggles should be shown *IN* the Inventory display itself, possibly to the right of "Inventory:" in the header line. Or at the very end, after the things list, on a line by themselves (line with just the toggle buttons I'm talking about here)

fix this grammar flaw, seen in feedback: "You has an empty stomach (...)"
