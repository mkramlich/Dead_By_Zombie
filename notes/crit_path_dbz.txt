-----------------

player MUST have way to learn on start level of existance of Jameson refugee house that's in Eastside

fix route_pair() fn:
	route/path CANNOT be placed in cell with pre-existing route or stairs

fruit decays/transforms/replaced-by into fruit seed, after X tocks since the fruit was created
	fruit seed can either be planted in ground (explicitly), or, if laying on ground may/will eventually turn into a new fruit tree

my attacks miss too often with the chainsaw
	finding: right now, the attack's chance to hit depends only on the attacker's atkchancehit NOT on the weapon and NOT on his skill
		change both those facts!
		any/every weapon (item that can be attacked with) should have a default or explicit (per-type/isntance) atkhitchance or modifier
		make some weapons have a higher inherent chance to hit, than other types (bat > knife; chainsaw > knife)

BUG: after i starved to death, and was dead (I could see my corpse on the map), and i was hitting 'timepass', my corpse was digesting food! (stomach cont decreasing each 'timepass'!)
	make sure that corpses do not digest or starve

MINOR BUG: i starved to death, causing game-over condition (only had timepass and reset-game button afterward) but in my devmode statusfn area it said "gameloss: False" -- then I hit timepass, THEN i saw a feedback message saying basically that I was dead and game over, and that point gameloss did change to True....maybe change code so that when I died gameloss becomes True immediaetlly, without having to press 'timepass' afterward before that occurs

MINOR BUG: in the 'all minds' report, i list a wielded item in the wielded section AND in the carried section - should just be in the wielded; wearing/worn is done correctly (shown in wearing but not in carried)

MINOR BUG: "You lost x hp due to starvation and now *HAS* x hp." --- fix that grammar, has should be have

ensure that dogs bark randomly sometimes; the bark should be a sound emitted, therefore, you might hear it as with any sound

food too scarce, you will always eventually starve to death

too easy to die, due to not enough healing items, too many zombies, and autoheal doesn't work if cur HP < half max....one or more of those factors needs to become friendlier

doctor NPC, has heal skill, and ability to 'heal' a seriously wounded human (NPC or you); you (the player) can ask a doctor to heal yourself, or to heal another NPC; doctors often found in hospitals; if someone is seriously hurt (hp <= max/2) then they won't naturally auto-heal over time; instead, only a doctor or serious/major medicine/healing items can help them

hospital: one exists in full game's scenario, always, in pre-defined location/level; hospital contains doctor(s) and healing items (medicine, bandages, first aid kit, splints, surgical tools, etc.)

gun item; you can wield it and 'shoot' it; shooting it fires a bullet(s) in a direction (one of 8 cmopass diractions, only); chance to hit (and dmg) depends on gun type, gun instance, shooter's skill, range to target, env conditions (day or night), etc.; gun has finite ammo loaded in it and expends bullet(s) per shot, and cannot fire once empty, but may be (re)loaded from 'loose'/unloaded ammo in your inventory; unlike bats/knives, a gun can hit/attack an enemy/target at a distance (whereas bats/knives limited to only adj cells)

soldier NPC; almost always has gun(s) and ammo; lots of soldiers found at a military base; soldiers tend to shoot zombies on sight

military base, a special location/level/place; there's one in the full game's scenario world, pre-defined

fire; a fire may exist in a cell (an empty cell, or a cell with a wall (in that case the wall is on fire); each tick, each fire cell may cause a new fire to be created in an adj cell to it; each tick, an existing fire may go out (most likely if no adj fires, or, if all adj cells have fire); fire maybe look like red '^' or '*' or '&' or '~' on map; fire cannot be created in cells with water floors; a fire extinguisher item exists which can be wielded and 'spray'-ed on adj fire cell to extinguish that fire; fire extinguisher items often found in fire station buildings; fire will cause X HP of dmg to all thinfs (lifeforms, items, whatever) in same cell or adj cell to it (more max dmg in same cell, less in adj cell; in same cell 100% of damaging it, but in adj cell chance is <=50% per tick of causing dmg to any given thing); wearing certain things (types of clothing/equipment) may give increased protection or immunity to fire; a fire may be created by using a certain item, like a lighter or match or if an explosion occurs

the "You see nearby: ...." feedback should have a relative direction indicator for each thing listed, like:
	You see nearby: a zombie (to the west), a dog (to the south-east)

the skill i'm increasing during attacks with my bat should be improving my subsequent attacks (chance to hit, max dmg, etc.)

way to heal if heavily wounded (hp <= max/2), possibly by using a firstaid kit or being healed by a doctor NPC (NPC with doctor skills who performs a 'doctor' action on you)

firstaidkit, medicine or bandages item could be green '%' character
	you can 'use' them (like 'eat'-ing a food item), it heals you up to X HP (varies by item/type), and item is consumed

doing "lock" on a door gave no feedback, so:
	make it give feedback, if it did something
	if did nothing, remove it from list of possible command choices

enforce hard limit on zombie count created, per wh instance

all corpses (of any kind, except a YouCorpse) need to rot away (delete) eventually (X tocks after corpse created) else it will cause memory leak

implement the "develop zombie cure to win" stuff, or, remove all mention of it from DBZ game and the site (sub benefits, etc.)

turn on digests and starves, by default (and in the initstate files)
    tune the numbers/behaviors for digesting and starving such that it's not TOO hard to survive, it merely requires some thought and planning, and pretty much only a bad player will starve to death
    tune the init level content and the code so that it's not too hard to keep enough food and not starve to death

impl the "pick lock" command, or, remove it from the Directed Actions action type select box; if latter, also remove mention of it from Help page 

Help page:
    stairs
    what ? means on the map
    expain that doors/windows look different whether open or closed, and what the symbols used are for each
    food, edible, eating, stomach, digestion, starvation
    doors: opening, closing, locking, unlocking, picking lock, attacking/destroying
    windows: opening, closing, attacking/destroying
    walls: they block movement, they have lots of HP, can be attacked/destroyed
    explain the "ask (not) follow", and "ask (not) not move" commands
    explain how zombies work, and zombi-fication
