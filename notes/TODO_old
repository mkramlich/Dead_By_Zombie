TODO - Dead By Zombie
-------------------------

Zombie Costume feature:
    add a pirate costume, and a witch costume, but just cosmetic, doesn't effect appearance on map, or behavior of creatures
    in the Costume Shop on start level put many pirate & witch costumes, they are just superficial, no effect

one guy's comments, taht the story would have to be really good, if it had a NetHack-like UI (meaning that since the UI is so simple/retro/non-ritzy, that the game play/mechanics/story has to be really good to counter-balance and compensate for it). fair point, and I agree. I need to revise the display board and flyer and booth material in general to better communicate to people WHY/HOW the game is good, creative, different, interesting enough, stands out, compelling, attractive
