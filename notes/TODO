TODO

topmost issues are generally highest priority and/or coming up next in my work queue

------------------------------------

way for player to destroy or disassemble a barricade; if wielding a weapon you can destroy a barricade but you cannot destroy a buildling Wall

if wielding axe/chainsaw, can chop down a tree (reldir action), whcih destroys the tree and creates wood on the ground there

you can eat a human corpse (it provides nutrition)

when you're dead (human corpse) don't show Stomach in UI, and instead of HP value say DEAD
    similar: when you're a zombie, don't show Stomach, do show HP, but also say ZOMBIE

fire; figure out the mechanics/lifecycle first; at a min, trees and wooden barricades can catch on fire if fire adjacent; rain can happen and tends to put out fires; how can fire be started? (player action using a lighter/matchsticks is one way)
 
explosives

a way for player to learn about the status of the world, what's happening with the zombie apocalypse

at game start, pretty soon the player should "hear" the sounds of other people in distress and crying/yelling for help, coming from elsewhere in town, from inside houses, etc. so have that immediate emotional pull and dilemma of whether to help others or ignore them and focus only on saving yourself

make the world much larger

elim all refs/support for Windows (reminder: web32 refs in the code; my Console wrapper/emu)

elim remaining vestiges of the original web UI version (Django refs, HtmlColors, HTML snippets, web-somethings, etc.)

extract the core engine (which I've privately named 'webhack') from DBZ into separate public github repo?

NetHack movement dir keys; right now it's confusing if your muscle memory expects NH's movement keys

support larger window sizes (map view subset should get bigger, dynamically/auto-detect, if not already)

migrate to using GUI lib (like Pygame/SDL) since more freedom in choosing UI appearance

carry over some features/ideas from Apoc Dawn and TactiHack

elim remaining refs to the Demo-vs-Full (Premium/License) system

elim refs to Wolfenhack

change all zombiehack/zh refs to DeadByZombie/dbz

when you hit 'S' to save, the app pauses mysteriously (the save is executing) from user's POV; better to let user know we got his command and have begun executing the save, so he expects a brief pause

elim all the dead code (some still leftover from the original webapp version of DBZ)

fix 'has' to 'have' and capitalize 'you': "you lost 1 hp due to starvation and now has 0 hp"

fix any imperfections that happen after you die

fix all known bugs

NPC humans digest and can starve to death

NPC humans can choose to eat human corpses in same cell if they are otherwise starving; likewise, if human corpse not in same cell, they'll move toward the nearest expected one
    NPC humans can pickup food; can move toward nearest expected food (to pick it up, and eventually eat it)

add a CLI client for playing the game (or at least running admin & analysis tasks against a world state); would have beneficial effect on the architecture; and be consistent with CLIFMO

consolidate ZombieHackDemoGameMode with ZombieHackFullGameMode
