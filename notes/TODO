topmost issues are generally highest priority and/or coming up next in my work queue

------------------------------------

script to convert the sshot tiffs to png

way to read old feedbacks, in case you missed something (like you noticed your a zombie now, want to see the feedback from recently pass tocks to learn exactly how it happened)

finish bomb code

every tock chance WarriorDoll says eerie things like "dead by dawn..." and chance it wiggles (fact that you feel wiggling sensation coming from your pocket/pack is mentioned in the feedback). is chance while on ground he effectively TP's to farther cell whenver player can't see him?

a way to use radio/internet/loudspeakers to send a broadcast telling the general public (other survivors) to go to a certain location (coords) if they need helper/shelter/protection. easy to specify your current location coords but you can also instead specify arbitrary coords/level/region; some/all NPCs can hear/see/receieve this (with approp devices & word-of-mouth) and will actually begin moving toward and/or simply appearing (TP or genesis) at/near the identified location

timebomb - you can enable/disable it; when you enable it it will explode in T tocks from that moment; when it explodes it destroys all things in radius R

mine - you can enable it; if on ground and enabled, and a creature moves into it's cell it explodes

way for player to destroy or disassemble a barricade; if wielding a weapon you can destroy a barricade but you cannot destroy a buildling Wall

if wielding axe/chainsaw, can chop down a tree (reldir action), whcih destroys the tree and creates wood on the ground there

you can eat a human corpse (it provides nutrition)

when you're dead (human corpse) don't show Stomach in UI, and instead of HP value say DEAD
    similar: when you're a zombie, don't show Stomach, do show HP, but also say ZOMBIE

when a zombie attacks, even if it doesn't kill, there's a chance it spreads the zombie infection to the victim (player or NPC); if a human has the zombie infection (but not yet a zombie) then each subsequent tock is small chance he'll become a Zombie

fire (on map: red caret); figure out the mechanics/lifecycle first; at a min, trees and wooden barricades can catch on fire if fire adjacent; rain can happen and tends to put out fires; how can fire be started? (player action using a lighter/matchsticks is one way)
 
explosives

a way for player to learn about the status of the world, what's happening with the zombie apocalypse

at game start, pretty soon the player should "hear" the sounds of other people in distress and crying/yelling for help, coming from elsewhere in town, from inside houses, etc. so have that immediate emotional pull and dilemma of whether to help others or ignore them and focus only on saving yourself

make the world much larger

elim all refs/support for Windows (reminder: web32 refs in the code; my Console wrapper/emu)

elim remaining vestiges of the original web UI version (Django refs, HtmlColors, HTML snippets, web-somethings, etc.)

extract the core engine (which I've privately named 'webhack') from DBZ into separate public github repo?

NetHack movement dir keys; right now it's confusing if your muscle memory expects NH's movement keys

support larger window sizes (map view subset should get bigger, dynamically/auto-detect, if not already)

migrate to using GUI lib (like Pygame/SDL) since more freedom in choosing UI appearance

carry over some features/ideas from Apoc Dawn and TactiHack

elim remaining refs to the Demo-vs-Full (Premium/License) system

elim refs to Wolfenhack

change all zombiehack/zh refs to DeadByZombie/dbz

when you hit 'S' to save, the app pauses mysteriously (the save is executing) from user's POV; better to let user know we got his command and have begun executing the save, so he expects a brief pause

elim all the dead code (some still leftover from the original webapp version of DBZ)

fix 'has' to 'have' and capitalize 'you': "you lost 1 hp due to starvation and now has 0 hp"

fix any imperfections that happen after you die

fix all known bugs

NPC humans digest and can starve to death

NPC humans can choose to eat human corpses in same cell if they are otherwise starving; likewise, if human corpse not in same cell, they'll move toward the nearest expected one
    NPC humans can pickup food; can move toward nearest expected food (to pick it up, and eventually eat it)

add a CLI client for playing the game (or at least running admin & analysis tasks against a world state); would have beneficial effect on the architecture; and be consistent with CLIFMO

consolidate ZombieHackDemoGameMode with ZombieHackFullGameMode

there is a chance that a civil emergency siren (aka, air raid siren) will begin to play. the fact that its playing will be described always until/unless it stops playing
