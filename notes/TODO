TODO

topmost issues are generally highest priority and/or coming up next in my work queue

------------------------------------

fix any imperfections that happen after you die

fix all known bugs

you should need some kind of material/resource to build a barricade; right now it's magic and can build an infinite amount of barricades
    also: way for player to destroy or disassemble a barricade

a way for player to learn about the status of the world, what's happening with the zombie apocalypse

at game start, pretty soon the player should "hear" the sounds of other people in distress and crying/yelling for help, coming from elsewhere in town, from inside houses, etc. so have that immediate emotional pull and dilemma of whether to help others or ignore them and focus only on saving yourself

make the world much larger

elim all refs/support for Windows (reminder: web32 refs in the code; my Console wrapper/emu)

elim remaining vestiges of the original web UI version (Django refs, HtmlColors, HTML snippets, web-somethings, etc.)

extract the core engine (which I've privately named 'webhack') from DBZ into separate public github repo?

NetHack movement dir keys; right now it's confusing if your muscle memory expects NH's movement keys

support larger window sizes (map view subset should get bigger, dynamically/auto-detect, if not already)

migrate to using GUI lib (like Pygame/SDL) since more freedom in choosing UI appearance

carry over some features/ideas from Apoc Dawn and TactiHack

elim remaining refs to the Demo-vs-Full (Premium/License) system

elim refs to Wolfenhack

change all zombiehack/zh refs to DeadByZombie/dbz

when you hit 'S' to save, the app pauses mysteriously (the save is executing) from user's POV; better to let user know we got his command and have begun executing the save, so he expects a brief pause

elim all the dead code (some still leftover from the original webapp version of DBZ)

fix 'has' to 'have' and capitalize 'you': "you lost 1 hp due to starvation and now has 0 hp"
