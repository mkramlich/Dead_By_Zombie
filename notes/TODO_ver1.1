shooting: attacking with gun-type items at a distance

interactive dialogue mode

zombies can break windows; a broken window can be moved through just like it were an open door or space-without-wall; when window gets broken, a sound is made; an unbroken window cannot be moved through; a broken window looks like an empty space

Region(): w,h: None,None
Region(): w,h: 30,20
Region(): w,h: 30,20

zombies have memories of their past lives. like to visit/hangout at places they inhabited when they were humans/alive (their home, job, etc.). some zombies are sad and will be crying. some zombies are filled with rage and vicious.
