TODO

elim all refs/support for Windows (reminder: web32 refs in the code; my Console wrapper/emu)

elim remaining vestiges of the original web UI version (Django refs, HtmlColors, HTML snippets, web-somethings, etc.)

delete all commented-out code

extract the core engine (which I've privately named 'webhack') from DBZ into separate public github repo?

NetHack movement dir keys; right now it's confusing if your muscle memory expects NH's movement keys

upgrade/bump to Python 2.7 or higher

support larger window sizes (map view subset should get bigger, dynamically/auto-detect, if not already)

migrate forward all ideas worth keeping & relevant from my original offline TODO files, into this TODO

elim use of dateutil package?

migrate to using GUI lib (like Pygame/SDL) since more freedom in choosing UI appearance

merge those 3 lib modules together and elim unused/redund

fix any imperfections that happen after you die

make the world much larger

carry over some features/ideas from Apoc Dawn and TactiHack

at game start, pretty soon the player should "hear" the sounds of other people in distress and crying/yelling for help, coming from elsewhere in town, from inside houses, etc. so have that immediate emotional pull and dilemma of whether to help others or ignore them and focus only on saving yourself

elim remaining refs to the Demo-vs-Full (Premium/License) system

elim refs to Wolfenhack

change all zombiehack/zh refs to DeadByZombie/dbz

make this warning go away:
/Users/groglogic/projects/mine/DeadByZombie/github/Dead_By_Zombie/src/deadbyzombie/webhack.py:8796: SyntaxWarning: name 'master_layoutmap' is assigned to before global declaration
  global master_layoutmap #TODO line seems unneeded. why did i do this?
