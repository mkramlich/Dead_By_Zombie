TODO

elim all refs/support for Windows (reminder: web32 refs in the code; my Console wrapper/emu)

elim/rename GROGDJANGO

elim refs to and distinction between Demo and Premium/License modes (demo vs full in initstate filenames)

rename core engine from webhack

elim remaining vestiges of the original web UI version (Django refs, HtmlColors, HTML snippets, web-somethings, etc.)

extract core engine from DBZ into separate public github repo?

NetHack movement dir keys

upgrade/bump to Python 2.7 or higher

support larger window sizes (map view subset should get bigger, dynamically/auto-detect, if not already)

migrate forward all ideas worth keeping & relevant from my original offline TODO files, into this TODO

elim use of dateutil package?

migrate to using GUI lib (like Pygame/SDL) since more freedom in choosing UI appearance

merge those 3 lib modules together and elim unused/redund

fix any imperfections that happen after you die

make the world much larger

change all zombiehack/zh refs to DeadByZombie/dbz

elim refs to Wolfenhack

delete all commented-out code

carry over some features/ideas from Apoc Dawn and TactiHack

at game start, pretty soon the player should "hear" the sounds of other people in distress and crying/yelling for help, coming from elsewhere in town, from inside houses, etc. so have that immediate emotional pull and dilemma of whether to help others or ignore them and focus only on saving yourself
